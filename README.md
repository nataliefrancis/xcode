# Xcode lightning talk

### What is Xcode?

Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS containing software development tools developed by Apple.

### Which languages does it support?

Xcode supports source code for the following programming languages: C, C++, Objective-C, Java, AppleScript, Python, Ruby, ResEdit (Rez), and Swift.

Third parties have added support for: GNU Pascal, Free Pascal, Ada, C#, Perl, and D.

An alternative to these is using frameworks and tools built on top of Apache Cordova (formerly PhoneGap) such as Ionic which then result in hybrid apps.

### v 9.1 new features:

* Faster/more advanced source code editor. 
* Xcode is directly linked to GitHub and will display all of your repos (and allow you to view branches and commits).
* New indexing engine runs as part of the build process so it understands your code automatically. 

### Where can you download it?

<https://developer.apple.com>
You will need to have an apple account, it will be required before you can download.
